## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-26

**Operational memory guide moved to code — eliminates the workspace migration gap.**

### Architectural change
- Split MEMORY.md into two concerns: **engineering knowledge** ("how the
  memory tools work, when to call them") now lives in code as the
  `_MEMORY_GUIDE` constant in `src/predacore/identity/engine.py`, and
  **user-curated content** (preferences, decisions, lessons) stays in the
  workspace `MEMORY.md`. The guide auto-updates with every release; user
  content is preserved across upgrades.
- New `IdentityEngine.memory_guide()` method returns the operational guide.
- `build_identity_prompt()` injects the guide as a "How Memory Works" section
  immediately before the workspace MEMORY.md content (now wrapped as
  "Curated Memory (MEMORY.md)"). Both layers are always present in the
  assembled prompt.
- New layer order: `… → memory_guide (code) → MEMORY (workspace) → TOOLS → …`

### Why
- Pre-1.3.0, operational guidance lived in `defaults/MEMORY.md` which was
  copied to a user's workspace on first install and never overwritten on
  upgrade. Adding/changing tools (e.g. v1.2.0's 4 new memory tools) meant
  existing users wouldn't see the updated guidance — they'd be acting on
  frozen instructions from whenever they first installed.
- Code-level constant means: rename a tool, add a new one, change the
  discipline rule — one edit, ships to every user on next pip upgrade,
  no migration logic, no "predacore doctor --fix-defaults" needed.

### MEMORY.md defaults stripped
- Shipped `defaults/MEMORY.md` is now a scaffold for curated content only —
  removed the dual-layer / 6-tool / infrastructure-layer sections (they
  moved to the code constant). Keeps the "What belongs here / What doesn't"
  guidance for the agent's own curation discipline.

### Tests
- 5 new tests in `test_memory_subsystem.py::TestMemoryGuideInPrompt`:
  guide is non-empty, mentions all 6 tools, present in prompt even with
  empty workspace MEMORY.md, coexists with curated content, and the
  shipped defaults file does NOT carry the operational content (regression
  guard for the 1.2.0 mistake).
- **205 deterministic tests passing** (200 prior + 5 new).

### Migration impact
- **Existing users get the new operational guide automatically** on
  upgrade — no manual `cp` step needed (unlike the v1.2.0 → 1.2.1 case),
  because the guide is now in the code path that runs on every prompt
  assembly. Their workspace `MEMORY.md` is left alone (still curated
  content only, still respected).
- The stale top-level `agents/default/MEMORY.md` developer mirror has
  been synced to match the new defaults shape; cleanup of that mirror
  remains deferred.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-26

**Patch — fixes two bugs shipped in 1.2.0.**

### Fixed
- `predacore --version` now correctly reports the installed version. Bumped
  stale `__version__` constant in `src/predacore/__init__.py` (was hardcoded
  to `"1.1.1"` and never bumped during the 1.2.0 release; package metadata
  was correct at 1.2.0 but the in-code string lagged). Importing
  `predacore.__version__` now matches the wheel's metadata.
- **MEMORY.md defaults sync**: the W7 update for the dual-layer memory model
  ("passive auto-context + active memory tools") and the 6-tool guidance was
  written to top-level `agents/default/MEMORY.md` (which doesn't ship in the
  wheel) instead of `src/predacore/identity/defaults/MEMORY.md` (the file
  that's actually copied to a user's workspace on bootstrap). Synced the W7
  content to the shipped defaults so fresh installs see the dual-layer
  guidance. **Existing users**: bootstrap does NOT overwrite an existing
  `~/.predacore/agents/default/MEMORY.md`, so to pick up the new defaults
  after upgrading, manually replace your workspace copy:
  ```bash
  cp $(python -c "import predacore.identity.defaults as d, pathlib; print(pathlib.Path(d.__file__).parent / 'MEMORY.md')") ~/.predacore/agents/default/MEMORY.md
  ```

### Known issue (not blocking)
- The top-level `agents/default/` directory at the repo root is a stale
  developer mirror that does NOT ship in the wheel. 4 files there
  (HEARTBEAT.md, IDENTITY.md, MEMORY.md, SOUL.md) diverge from the canonical
  `src/predacore/identity/defaults/` versions; for HEARTBEAT/IDENTITY/SOUL the
  defaults are NEWER, while MEMORY.md was edited at the top level (1.2.0's W7
  bug — fixed here). Treat `src/predacore/identity/defaults/` as canonical
  going forward. Cleanup of the top-level mirror deferred to a separate PR.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-26

**Phase 2 memory upgrade — auto-trigger wiring, project isolation, verify-with-code.**

### Added
- **Auto-trigger wiring** — `Edit`/`Write` automatically reindex via `reindex_file()`;
  `git checkout/merge/rebase/reset/pull/cherry-pick/revert` automatically sync via
  `sync_git_changes(prior_head=)`. Captures both working-tree AND committed deltas
  (closes the gap that POST-only hook architectures still have).
- **Project isolation** — `project_id` auto-detected from env → git rev-parse → cwd
  basename → "default". 60s TTL cache, `ALL_PROJECTS="all"` sentinel for cross-project
  queries. Filters surface a `project_mismatch` counter in `recall_explain`. Eliminates
  cross-project pollution in shared DBs.
- **Verify-with-code layer** — `recall(verify=True, verify_drop=True)` checks each
  result's chunk content against the current `source_path` on disk. Achieves true
  100% accuracy on code-backed memories. Three-state verdict (True/False/None)
  preserves synthesis memories that have no source.
- **Per-stage retrieval trace** — `_invariant_skips` counter with 5 keys
  (stale_verification, orphaned, version_skew, project_mismatch, verification_failed)
  surfaced via `get_stats()`. Sophisticated `recall_explain()` shows what each filter
  dropped at each stage.
- **4 new memory tools** — `memory_get`, `memory_delete`, `memory_stats`,
  `memory_explain`. Auto-approve list opens read-only ops; `memory_delete` deliberately
  requires confirmation (destructive).
- **Eager BGE warmup at boot** — `subsystem_init` calls embedder once on init when
  `eager_warmup=True`. Replaces "first recall is cold" with "first recall is hot"
  on every process start.
- **Healer auto-start** — `SubsystemFactory` starts the background drift / orphan /
  snapshot daemon when `enable_healer=True`. New `MemoryConfig` flags + env vars:
  `PREDACORE_MEMORY_ENABLE_HEALER`, `_SCAN_SECRETS`, `_EAGER_WARMUP`.
- **Ingress secret scan** — `store()` refuses content matching API-key/credential
  patterns; increments `_safety_stats`. Defense-in-depth on top of file ignores.
- **3 new memory modules** — `chunker.py` (AST/markdown/brace/window strategies),
  `safety.py` (secret scanner + `MemoryIgnore`), `healer.py` (background daemon),
  `project_id.py` (auto-detection helper).
- **Rich tool descriptions** — `memory_store` 56→1540 chars, `memory_recall`
  36→1347 chars. Encodes WHEN-TO-CALL / WHEN-NOT / quality rules so agents use
  memory deliberately, not reflexively.
- **`agents/default/MEMORY.md`** updated with dual-layer model: passive auto-context
  + active memory tools, "code is canonical, memory is for synthesis".

### Changed
- `predacore.memory` exports 9 symbols (was 3) — adds `Healer`, `MemoryIgnore`,
  `scan_for_secrets`, `chunk_text`, `safe_read_text`, `is_sensitive_path`.
- `recall_explain()` rewritten with sophisticated per-stage trace (replaces v1).
- `auto_approve_tools` extended for read-only memory ops.

### Tests
- **+200 deterministic tests** (3.69s) across 8 new test files: chunker / safety /
  project_id (70), store augmentations (34), tool handlers (28), subsystem +
  Healer wiring (27), e2e auto-trigger round-trips (14), verify-with-code (16),
  infrastructure smoke (11).
- **+5 LLM-gated tests** (Gemini Flash behavioral, `--real` flag).
- `pytest-timeout = 60s` global cap; `asyncio_mode = "auto"`.

### Packaging
- `predacore` 1.1.1 → 1.2.0 (Python-only — `predacore_core` Rust wheel unchanged at 1.1.1).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-24

**Phase 1 memory upgrade — HNSW at scale, v2 schema, trust-weighted ranking.**

### Added
- **Schema v2** with 14 invariant columns (`trust_source`, `verification_state`, `embedding_version`, `chunker_version`, `anchor_hash`, `content_hash`, `parent_id`, `chunk_ordinal`, `superseded_at`, `superseded_by`, `last_verified_at`, `source_blob_sha`, `source_mtime`, `decay_score`). Idempotent v1 → v2 migrator runs on first open; existing rows backfill safely.
- **Trust-weighted retrieval ranking** — recall score multiplied by `user_corrected=1.00`, `code_extracted=0.95`, `user_stated=0.90`, `claude_inferred=0.60` (alongside time decay and confidence).
- **Supersede API** — `store(supersedes=[...])` atomically replaces old rows; `recall(show_superseded=False)` hides them by default. Clean way to correct/update memories without losing history.
- **HNSW vector index** — `_HnswVectorIndex` opt-in via `PREDACORE_USE_HNSW=1`. Rust-backed via `hnsw_rs 0.3`, tombstone-based deletes, shared interface with `_NumpyVectorIndex`. O(log n) cosine ANN search instead of O(n) linear scan. Tuned for ~99.9% recall at 1M vectors: `M=32`, `ef_construction=400`, `ef_search=400`, `MAX_VECTORS=1,000,000`.
- **Vector index persistence** — `.npz` cache of numpy backend survives daemon restarts; safe-skipped on row-count or embedding-version drift.
- **Python 3.13** classifier added.
- **`predacore --version`** flag.

### Changed
- **Context budget** raised 36k → 80k tokens (model-agnostic).
- **Rust embedding** `MAX_SEQ_LEN` bumped 256 → 512 for longer memory content.
- **Dependency pin** tightened: `predacore_core>=1.1.1`.

### Packaging
- `predacore_core` 0.1.2 → 1.1.1 (coordinated bump, reset series).
- `predacore` 0.1.5 → 1.1.1.
- Cross-platform wheels on PyPI: linux-x86_64, macOS universal2, windows-x86_64, sdist.

### Tests
- 51 new schema-migration tests covering migration, supersede, recall filters, trust ranking, context budget, vector cache, HNSW semantics.
- Fixed pre-existing asyncio flake in `test_memory.py` (replaced deprecated `get_event_loop` with `asyncio.run`).
- **139 tests passing** locally.

### Live migration
- Ran successfully on the 80-row production DB: zero data loss, schema jumped 17 → 33 columns, legacy rows defaulted to `trust_source=claude_inferred` (conservative 0.60× multiplier) and `verification_state=unverified` (healer processes over time).
